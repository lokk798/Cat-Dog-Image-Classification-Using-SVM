# Cat and Dog Image Classification using SVM

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to classify images of cats and dogs. Initially, an SVM model is trained on the dataset, but due to overfitting and high computational requirements, alternative approaches are considered for future work.

## Challenges

During the project, several challenges were encountered:

- **Overfitting**: The model performs well on the training data but poorly on the test data, indicating overfitting.
- **Computational Demands**: The high-dimensional nature of the image data leads to significant computational overhead, making model training resource-intensive.

## Future Work

To address the issues of overfitting and computational demands, future work will focus on implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNNs are better suited for image classification tasks and are expected to improve both accuracy and efficiency.
